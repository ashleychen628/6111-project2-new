American computer scientist and businessman (born 1973) In this name that follows East Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is Mikhailovich and the family name is Brin.

He was the president of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., until stepping down from the role on December 3, 2019.[1] He and Page remain at Alphabet as co-founders, controlling shareholders and board members. As of March 2025, Brin is the 9th-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $164 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes.[2][3] Brin immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of six. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, College Park, following in his father's and grandfather's[4][5] footsteps by studying mathematics as well as computer science. After graduation, in September 1993, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he built a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and he discontinued his PhD studies to start Google in Susan Wojcicki 's garage in Menlo Park.[6] Early life and education[edit] Sergey Mikhailovich Brin was born on August 21, 1973, in Moscow in the Soviet Union,[7] to Russian Jewish parents,[8] Mikhail and Eugenia Brin (1948–2024), both graduates of Moscow State University (MSU).[9] His father is a retired mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother was a researcher at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center.[10][11][12] The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother.[10] In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate.[10] They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978, and as a result, his father was "promptly fired". For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.[10] The Brin family lived in Vienna and Paris while Mikhail Brin secured a teaching position at the University of Maryland with help from Anatole Katok. During this time, the Brin family received support and assistance from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. They arrived in the United States on October 25, 1979.[10][13] Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Maryland. In September 1990, Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of Computer Science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics at the age of 19.[14] In 1993, he interned at Wolfram Research, the developers of Mathematica.[14] Brin began his graduate study in computer science at Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation, receiving an M.S. in computer science in 1995.[15] As of 2008[update], he was on leave from his PhD studies at Stanford.[16] Search engine development[edit] Left to right, Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, 2008 During an orientation for new students at Stanford, he met Larry Page. The two men seemed to disagree on most subjects, but after spending time together they "became intellectual soul-mates and close friends." Brin's focus was on developing data mining systems while Page's was on extending "the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers".[17] Together, they authored a paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine".[18] To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to those existing at the time.[19] The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page.[20] Combining their ideas, they began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.[19] After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.[21] Page and Brin used Page's basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google was made available on the Stanford Web site.[19] By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows: The mathematical website interlinking that the PageRank algorithm facilitates, illustrated by size-percentage correlation of the circles. The algorithm was named after Page himself. Some Rough Statistics (from August 29, 1996) Total indexable HTML urls: 75.2306Million Total content downloaded: 207.022gigabytes... BackRub is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux. The primary database is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks. - Larry Page page cs.stanford.edu[22] BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: "We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages."[23] Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: "Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real."[21] Some compared Page and Brin's vision to the impact of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing: In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts—originally replicated by hand—to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading

Brin earned his master’s degree in computer science at Stanford, where he and Page developed the “PageRank” algorithm, which calculated the relevance of a web page to the user’s query based in part on the number of other pages that linked to it. PageRank helped make Google the world’s dominant search engine. Today, Brin directs Google’s special projects such as its famed driverless-car initiative. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship. He has received the Marconi Prize, given to those who achieve advances in communications and information technology for the social, economic and cultural development of all humanity.

How we started and where we are today - Google - About Google Jump to Content About Products Company Info News Our story From the garage to the Googleplex The Google story begins in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry Page was
considering Stanford for grad school and Sergey Brin, a student there, was
assigned to show him around. By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first
meeting, but by the following year they struck a partnership. Working from
their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the
importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web. They called this search
engine Backrub. Soon after, Backrub was renamed Google (phew). The name was a play on the
mathematical expression for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros and aptly
reflected Larry and Sergey's mission âto organize the worldâs information and
make it universally accessible and useful.â Over the next few years, Google caught the attention of not only the academic
community, but Silicon Valley investors as well. In August 1998, Sun
co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote Larry and Sergey a check for $100,000, and
Google Inc. was officially born. With this investment, the newly incorporated
team made the upgrade from the dorms to their first office: a garage in
suburban Menlo Park, California, owned by Susan Wojcicki (employee #16 and
former CEO of YouTube). Clunky desktop computers, a ping pong table, and
bright blue carpet set the scene for those early days and late nights. (The
tradition of keeping things colorful continues to this day.) Even in the beginning, things were unconventional: from Googleâs initial
server (made of Lego) to the first âDoodleâ in 1998: a stick figure in the logo announcing to site visitors that the
entire staff was playing hooky at the Burning Man Festival. âDon't be evilâ
captured the spirit of our intentionally unconventional methods. In the years
that followed, the company expanded rapidly â hiring engineers, building a
sales team, and introducing the first company dog, Yoshka. Google outgrew the garage and eventually moved to its current headquarters
(a.k.a.âThe Googleplexâ) in Mountain View, California. The spirit of doing
things differently made the move. So did Yoshka. The relentless search for better answers continues to be at the core of
everything we do. Today, Google makes hundreds of products used by billions of
people across the globe, from YouTube and Android to Gmail and, of course,
Google Search. Although weâve ditched the Lego servers and added just a few
more company dogs, our passion for building technology for everyone has stayed
with us â from the dorm room, to the garage, and to this very day..
