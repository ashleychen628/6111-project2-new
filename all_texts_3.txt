She spent most of her career playing for OL Reign[a] of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and the United States national team. Winner of the Ballon d'Or Féminin and named The Best FIFA Women's Player in 2019,[3][4] Rapinoe won gold with the national team at the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and played at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, where the U.S. finished second. Rapinoe co-captained the national team alongside Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan from 2018 to 2020.[5][6] She previously played for the Chicago Red Stars, Philadelphia Independence, and magicJack in Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), as well as Lyon Women in France's Division 1 Féminine. Rapinoe is internationally known for her crafty style of play and her activism off the pitch.[7][8][9] Her precise cross to Abby Wambach in the 122nd minute of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup quarterfinal match against Brazil resulted in an equalizer and eventual win for the Americans after a penalty shootout. The last-minute goal received ESPN's 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play of the Year. During the 2012 London Olympics, she scored three goals and tallied a team-high four assists to lead the United States to a gold medal. She is the first player, male or female, to score a goal directly from a corner at the 2012 Olympic Games, having done so twice. She won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball awards at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.[10] Rapinoe is an advocate for numerous LGBTQIA+ organizations, including GLSEN and Athlete Ally. In 2013, she received the Board of Directors Award from the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. Rapinoe was included in Time ' s 100 Most Influential People of 2020.[11] In July 2022, Rapinoe received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Joe Biden.[12] Early life Rapinoe grew up in Redding, California, with her parents, Jim and Denise, and five siblings, including her fraternal twin Rachael Rapinoe. Denise and Jim raised seven children together, not all their own. Denise has a son and daughter, Michael and Jenny, from a previous marriage; then came older brother Brian and then the twins five years later. Jim and her grandfather Jack both served in the Army.[13] She has Italian (from her paternal grandfather) and Irish ancestry.[14] She idolized her older brother Brian and started playing soccer at age three after watching him play the sport,[15] but he started using drugs when the girls were in second grade.[13] When she was ten and he was fifteen, he was put in juvenile detention, and was thereafter in and out of various prisons including Pelican Bay State Prison. Brian has since made a determined effort to avoid drugs after seeing his younger sister's success in international soccer.[16] High school Rapinoe spent most of her youth playing with teams coached by her father until high school.[17] Instead of playing soccer at Foothill High School, Rapinoe played for the Elk Grove Pride club team, located south of Sacramento.[18][19] She competed in track as a freshman and sophomore; competed in basketball as a freshman, sophomore, and senior; and was on the honor roll every semester of high school.[19] Rapinoe was named Parade and National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) All-American as a junior and senior. She was named to McDonald's All-American Girls High School Soccer West Team in 2004.[20] Rapinoe played for the under-14 Northern California state Olympic Development Program (ODP) team in 1999, as well as the regional ODP team in 2002.[21] Elk Grove United, 2002–2005 From 2002 to 2005, Rapinoe played for Elk Grove Pride in the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) along with her sister, Rachael, and future national teammate, Stephanie Cox.[22][23] She and her family commuted two-and-a-half hours from her hometown to play with the team.[24] During the US Youth Soccer National Championships, she scored an equalizer goal in the 18th minute to tie the game 1–1 against the Peachtree City Lazers. Elk Grove United finished second at the nationals after the Lazers scored a game-winning goal in the second half.[25] University of Portland Pilots, 2005–2008 Megan early years. Rapinoe and her sister attended the University of Portland in Portland, Oregon. The Rapinoe twins almost committed to Santa Clara University before choosing to play for the Portland Pilots on full scholarships.[26] Rapinoe played in the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship in 2004, where the United States finished third. The result was that she did not play college soccer in that year.[27] In 2005, as a freshman, Rapinoe helped the Pilots to an undefeated season and the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship. During the College Cup quarterfinal against Notre Dame, she scored twice and served one assist, helping the Pilots win 3–1 and advance in the College Cup.[28] During the College Cup final against UCLA, she scored one goal and served an assist helping the Pilots win 4–0.[29] She was named NSCAA First Team All-American and was on the Soccer America First Team Freshman All-America. Rapinoe made the NCAA Women's Soccer Championship All Tournament Team and was the West Coast Conference Freshman of the Year.[30] She was also named to the All-West Coast Conference First Team and the All-West Coast Conference Freshman Team. Rapinoe played and started all 25 games as an attacking midfielder, scoring 15 goals and adding 13 assists for 43 points – ranking fifth for freshman point totals in the school's history.[21] That year, she also scored seven game-winning goals.[19] "I know this sounds weird, but getting hurt was one of the best things that ever happened to me. It really gave me a different perspective. Before, everything was going how it was supposed to be and I wasn't really appreciative of w

In reality, Roberts has no desire to see Rapinoe break a bone of any kind as she attempts to lead her team to a second consecutive title in the Women’s World Cup final against the Netherlands on Sunday. (She is nursing what she described to reporters as a minor hamstring muscle strain but has said she will play in the final in Lyon, France). But Roberts’ comment underscores the uneasy relationship between the woman who has become the defiant face of U.S. soccer and the sun-baked land of Trump supporters she calls home. A plaque honoring U.S. women’s national team winger Megan Rapinoe hangs on the Shasta County Sports Hall of Fame wall at the field house of the Big League Dreams sports park in Redding, Calif., on Thursday, July 4, 2019. Rapinoe grew up in Redding. (Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group) Shasta County, about 250 miles north of San Francisco, is where California takes a hard right, where people wave the flag and hold their conservative ideology tight. Now they have a homegrown, world-famous sports star with lavender-streaked hair who is both “out,” and outspoken. “It is interesting to watch people pretzel themselves to say, ‘We love her and we want to claim her but we also don’t support her as a person,’ ” Shasta College sociology professor Heather Wylie said. Rapinoe, who turned 34 on Friday, is the leader of a group of talented soccer players who have transcended sport and become a cultural phenomenon. In the past, no one paid much attention to women’s soccer. But the women’s team has overshadowed their U.S. male counterparts, who also are playing Sunday in an important North American regional championship against Mexico — not that many fans seem to care. The turnaround has largely been a product of battles Rapinoe (pronounced Rap-een-NO) has led. She has taken on the White House and a century’s worth of presumption about the relative status of male and female athletes. She unabashedly uses her platform to promote feminist issues: She was the first

LogOut HOMEPAGE Sports The Mystical Megachurch Ruling Over Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe’s Hometown FAULT LINES Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty Bethel Church in Redding, California, is pro-Trump, believes in conversion therapy, and endorses “faith healing” and “dead raising”—a far cry from its most famous resident. Tarpley Hitt Reporter Published Jul. 20 2019 5:41AM EDT In the hours after Megan Rapinoe and the U.S. women’s national soccer team’s World Cup victory, the footballer celebrated on Instagram with a photo of her hometown paper, the Record Searchlight. The caption read: “Hometown love is the best kind of love.” Rapinoe grew up in the small logging town of Redding, California, and has maintained a close relationship with the community. She runs spring soccer clinics, regularly comes home for the annual Redding Rodeo, and even spearheaded a fundraiser after the Carr Fire destroyed several local homes. In the past, the town has celebrated their homegrown celebrity: in 2015, Redding declared July 21 “Megan Rapinoe Day,” named a street in her honor, and changed the address of their soccer field to “15 Rapinoe Way,” after her jersey number. But Redding’s relationship with Rapinoe has grown uneasy. In a recent Record Searchlight letter to the editor, a resident called the soccer player “a selfish unpatriotic bigot and a total disgrace to our national team.” In a follow-up article, an ex-firefighter told the Searchlight he “hope[s] she breaks her legs.” As a general rule, Redding skews conservative. Shasta County, represented by Republican Doug LaMalfa in the House, is one of the most solidly red counties in California—roughly 64 percent of local voters are registered Republicans and in 2016, the county turned out overwhelmingly for Trump, including Rapinoe’s father. In June, when Rapinoe kneeled during the National Anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, she irked many of her old neighbors. That sentiment compounded when Rapinoe announced she would not go to the White House if she won the World Cup, and joined the roster of public figures singled out on the president’s Twitter. “The team being invited to the White House, Americas house, is an honor,” said Karen Margrave, a Redding realtor who first expressed her anger on Facebook. “It doesn’t matter whether or not you like the President, you’re representing Americas Soccer Team! Everything doesn’t have to be political.” How Megan Rapinoe Became Soccer’s Middle Finger to Trump OUTSPOKEN Jordan Julian, Melissa Leon Rapinoe’s international celebrity has put Redding and its political fault lines in the spotlight. But the politics of Redding are complicated beyond simple party affiliations, in part because the town is also home to another divisive, wildly successful, cultural claim to fame: the Bethel Church. The multimillion-dollar revivalist megachurch has stirred controversy in Rapinoe’s hometown and throughout the religious world for its embrace of consumerist Christianity, extensive gay conversion therapy programs (Rapinoe is an out lesbian), and semi-mystical practices. Bethel members believe that miracles can occur on earth, and YouTube is filled with footage of their efforts: from faith healing, to “ fire tunneling ” (where members form a “tunnel” with two lines and pray over people passing through), to “ grave sucking ”—where someone lies on a grave to “suck up” the dead person’s blessings (a Bethel spokesperson, who wrote to The Daily Beast after this article first published, said that the Church discourages this practice). Bethel wields immense local influence: of Redding’s 90,000 residents, 11,233 are Bethel members, according to a report from northern California magazine A News Cafe. They maintain an extensive media presence—including a TV subscription service with 19,000 subscribers, two weekly podcasts with downloads in the millions, several well-attended annual conferences, and a music production arm with multiple chart-topping hits. (Justin Bieber is a fan; last year, he covered one of their singles, “Reckless Love”). Media and product sales alone earned Bethel some $23 million last year, according to A News Cafe, but the registered “nonprofit” organization also generates income from a K-8 academy called Bethel Christian School, an online and summer program called WorshipU, the Bethel School of Technology, the Bethel Conservatory of the Arts, and recently announced plans for the Bethel Business School. Most famously: they operate the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry, where each year some 2,000 students pay $12,050 ($5,250 per year) to study at the unaccredited three-year seminary, also known as “Christian Hogwarts.” “ The church’s strengthening grip on the town has bred suspicion and resentment among non-Bethel residents which far exceeds any angst over Megan Rapinoe. ” Bethel plays a unique role in the political landscape of Redding. The town’s mayor, Julie Winter, serves on Bethel’s Board of Elders and the church—which reported a budget of $60.8 million last fiscal year, in an area with a $46,389 median income —has funded several city initiatives. In 2011, when Redding considered closing its civic auditorium for financial reasons, Bethel offered to lease and manage it for the town, putting in some $1 million for repairs and paying an annual rent of $750,000, according to a press release from last year. In 2017, when the police force faced budget cuts, Bethel donated $500,000 to the unit, and then spearheaded a campaign to raise an additional $740,000 to pay the salaries of four officers. Just months later, the council unanimously voted to approve construction for a new, $96-million church campus, despite widespread local concern. As an enthusiastic article in Zôcalo Public Square put it: “Bethel’s engagement with Redding is big and broad, touching almost every aspect of civic life.” The church’s strengthening grip on the town has bred suspicion and resentment among non-Bethel residents which far exceeds any angst over Megan Rapinoe. Spokespeople for the Bethel Church, the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry, Bethel Senior Leader Bill Johnson and Bethel Senior Associate Leader Kris Valloton declined to speak with The Daily Beast for this story. In a statement provided by email, a Bethel representative wrote: “We celebrate the US Women’s Soccer Team’s historic fourth win of the World Cup and join in applauding our hometown’s talented athlete, Megan Rapinoe, and the success she has achieved on the world stage!” The roots of Bethel date back to 1954, when the church opened in Redding as an affiliate of a Pentecostal denomination called the Assemblies of God. For years, Bethel existed as a modest offshoot. That changed in 1996, when a pastor named Bill Johnson signed on to lead the ministry. According to Johnson’s personal biography, he accepted the job on a single condition: “I was born for revival and would pursue revival—this was not negotiable.” Once he took over, the church began to grow and, as Johnson put it, “to see many healings including multiple cases of cancer healed.” In 1998, Johnson and an auto repairman-turned-prophet named Kris Vallotton opened the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry. The goal, according to an alumni report, was to “equip and deploy revivalists who passionately pursue worldwide transformation in their God-given spheres of influence.” The first class had 36 students; by 2010, there were 1,500. Now, the school boasts more than 10,000 alumni. Creative Commons Much of the local resentment toward Bethel involves their practice of “faith healing,” or the belief that physical ailments can be cured by prayer. According to Redding residents, it’s common for Bethel members to approach pedestrians and offer to help with minor ailments. “They stop you and ask to pray for something that they think is wrong with you,” said Nathan Blaze, a 15-year Redding resident and the administrator of two Redding-themed meme pages: “Redding Be Like” and “Bethel Memes.” But Bethel members direct faith healing at more serious and permanent conditions. Will Smith, a former Bethel member who lives in the Bay Area, said congregants often approach his friend’s son, who lives with cerebral palsy, offering to cure his illness—a gesture the child and his parents find distressing. Faith healers believe all health concerns are curable with enough effort, from cancer to HIV to actually being dead—a Bethel alum maintains something called a “Dead Raising Team.” In a survey of Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry alumni from 2018, graduates claimed to have healed 50,000 people since last year, “including several dead raisings!” It’s a practice that secular citizens have found traumatic: In 2008, a Shasta County man sued a Bethel student over an accident which left him paraplegic. The man claimed she had pushed him off a cliff and, upon thinking he had died, attempted to faith heal him rather than call 9-1-1 (a judge later ruled in favor or the student). “ The Bethel lady brought several people up to[Orian’s] room. They were up there for like four days, trying to revive him...It got too out of control. We had to just ban them from the room. ” Still, the practice continued. On January 2, 2014, a 15-year-old boy named Orian LeBlanc suffered from an asthma attack and collapsed in the street. A Bethel student named Andrea Martin found his body. According to the boy’s grandmother, Donna Zibull, doctors said LeBlanc was still alive when she found him—he had passed out from lack of oxygen and cardiac arrest. But in a post on Facebook, Martin claimed the boy had already died and that after she’d prayed, paramedic

Chad New, executive director of the California Soccer Park, said the company and the city of Redding could not pass up the opportunity to honor the women's team and Rapinoe as they competed on such a large world stage.

Rapinoe put the U.S. on the board in the 61st minute when she scored on a penalty kick. The crowds watching at the soccer park cheered as Rapinoe held her arms out in celebration. It was Rapinoe's sixth goal of the tournament, and at 34 she became the oldest player to score in a women's World Cup final. Rapinoe, who grew up in Palo Cedro and celebrated her birthday two days ago, also gave a shout out to her older brother, Brian, who marked his birthday Sunday. In a story on ESPN.com Megan Rapinoe said her older brother, who has suffered through years of drug addiction, was an early positive influence on her and helped teach her to play soccer.

Simons said she was glad to see women's sports getting such prominent coverage in the news, after so many years of men's sports dominating. "I think it's cool that people are watching women's sports," said Simons, who was sporting an Alex Morgan jersey. Simons said when she bought the jersey she couldn't find a Rapinoe jersey at a local store. Ashley Schlegel brought her three daughters out to the park to watch the game, with 7-year-old Evelyn waving a small American flag. "We just wanted to show our support for the women's team and for Megan Rapinoe," Ashley Schlegel said. Bri Johnson of Redding said games like the one Sunday don't come along often, especially with a hometown star on the team. "How often does our country get in the World Cup, and get into the World Cup and have a local superstar? I think it's great," Johnson said.

TOPICS: Alex Morgan California Carr Fire Enterprise High School FIFA Geography Of California Megan Rapinoe Redding REDDING, Calif.  — A bus full of students and their families affected by the Carr Fire, chanted "Team U.S.A." as they left Shasta High School in Redding, headed for Avaya Stadium in San Jose to join athlete and Redding native, Megan Rapinoe.. Students were invited by Rapinoe and The United States Women's Soccer Team to join them in their national match against Chile, a fundraiser set up by Rapinoe to help families recovering from the Carr Fire. Part of a series of tweets from the national soccer star read, "We can help them to rebuild, we can help them to heal, we can stand with them as this community gets back on its feet and becomes better than it has ever been.". Nicko Wallis and his sister, Ella, are not only siblings but soccer mates, something that has kept them together during tough times. "My parents got a divorce right before this happened so I didn't really get to move...I remember there was a lot of helicopters," said Nicko. "There was a lot of people out of their cars looking around. There was people panicking, rapidly putting stuff in their cars.". Since the Carr Fire destroyed their mother's home, the family has been in recovery mode, looking to friends and each other. Tuesday, the day of the game, the two showed up wearing "Team U.S.A." T-shirts, and said they are ready to experience a game they never imagined watching in person. "A. 'Cause skipping school. B. I like soccer and I want to see high-level soccer. C. It's an international game and that's like a lifetime experience," said Nicko. Ella,15 is a Shasta High School student, and agreed soccer is their outlet. "I am a left-center midfielder, I'm pretty aggressive," said Ella. Ella was born with one arm. She said she does not let that stop her from taking to the soccer field with her teammates.. "I try to keep my head up so I can look around the field and make easy passes, but good passes," said Ella.. Ella said the motto has gotten her through various times in life and if she has learned anything through her struggle and through the fire, it is to believe in yourself and those around you. "I have not gotten bullied because of my arm. I do still sometimes question myself about, you know, am I good enough or do I deserve to be on the soccer team I am on now. I look up to Rapinoe, Pugh, Alex Morgan and Wambach to see how they persevered through their struggles and got to where they are and I hope I can do that someday," said Ella.. Redding high schools attending the U.S. Women's Soccer Game are: Shasta High School Grant Elementary School University Preparatory School Old Shasta Elementary Foothill High School Chrysalis Charter School Enterprise High School Boulder Creek Elementary School Turtle Bay School Redding School of the Arts Mountain View Middle School The match will take place at Avaya Stadium in San Jose on Tuesday, September 4 at 7:00 pm..

BR JP EN EU Tomboys Megan Rapinoe OL Reign | United States Jul 4, 2016 Let me take you back to a darker time. Close your eyes. K-Ci & JoJo was on the radio. Pogs were being slammed. Computers were for playing Oregon Trail. And most Americans still thought soccer â¦ well, to be honest, they werenât really thinking about soccer... Let me take you back to 1996... This was the summer when it all changed for me. First day of school. Sixth grade... My twin sister, Rachael, and I grew up playing with the boys. We ran around the mean streets of Redding, California, like wild animals. Basketball. Soccer. Flag football. Street hockey. We did it all... We were rocking bowl cuts, loving life. At the time, I didnât see myself as a âgirl.â I didnât see myself as anything. I was just having a blast... Then I came back from summer vacation, and stepped into my sixth grade classroom. Probably wearing sweatpants. Big smile on my face. âHey everyboâ Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?â.. Record skip... Everything had changed. The boys were standing on one side of the room. The girls were huddled on the other side, gossiping. They had pictures of Jonathan Taylor Thomas on their plastic folders... Bam. My whole world was rocked. I remember going home and sitting in my room wondering, What the hell happened last summer?.. I went from having all these friends, from knowing how to act and carry myself, to feeling really alone... I was lost... This is when I first heard the word â¦.. TOMBOY. I canât do this alone. So I told The Playersâ Tribune that I wanted to bring along my pals for this article. Weâre currently sitting in an Airbnb in Dallas, eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. Ballinâ... Friends! Introduce yourselves.. Rachael Rapinoe. Meganâs older sister. By 11 seconds. Tomboy.. Carmelina Moscato. Proud retired Canadian womenâs soccer player. Friend of Megan (to the chagrin of my Canadian teammates). Tomboy. Lori Lindsey.. Proud retired American womenâs soccer player. Friend of Megan ever since the â06 national team training camp in Los Angeles, when our life was basically Top Gun and we played beach volleyball every day. Tomboy... Megan:.. I want to get to gender and politics and all kinds of HOT BUTTON ISSUES in a minute. But first, letâs paint a picture. Everyone tell me the most embarrassing thing about your sixth-grade self... Lori:.. I was like beyond a tomboy because I was also really into skateboarding. I wanted to be Tony Hawk. I had a subscription to TransWorld SKATEboarding. In Indiana... Megan:.. Oh my God. What did your dad think?.. Lori:.. Oh, Little Larry? He thought I was crazy. I gave myself a chili-bowl haircut. Remember that style? I actually wanted to shave one side and have the other side longer... Carmelina:.. Thatâs in now. You could be a hipster... Lori:.. In the â90s, this was not O.K. My stepmom thought it made me look too much like a boy, so she made me get a perm... Megan:.. Oh, no. What happens when you perm a chili bowl? I can imagine that turned out fantastic. Lori:.. Huge blonde mushroom. I was sitting there in the salon with all the 50-year-old women getting permed... Rachael:.. How old were you?.. Lori:.. Twelve... Megan:.. Stop... Lori:.. I smelled like the perm for three days. And I was so much of a little boy that I didnât know how to take care of it. So picture it. Sixth grade. Indianapolis. I walk in with my big feathered perm. What could go wrong?.. Megan:.. I wouldâve killed to know you then. We wouldâve been besties... Lori:.. Wait, I didnât tell you all of it. I would wear a flannel shirt and only button the top button. The others would be left open. And then my shoes. Oh, God. My stepmom got us the generic white sneakers. Like from Payless or whatever. But I was obsessed with the Air Jordans. So I made my own. With construction paper... Megan:.. Thatâs so awesome. Getting the Jordan 11s was one of the happiest days of my life. Lori:.. Remember, one of the first pairs of Air Jordans had the triangle on the side? So Iâd take construction paper, cut out the triangle design and put a little hole for the shoelace to go through... Megan:.. I need to know so much more. Then you glued it, or what?. Lori:.. I think I just Scotch-taped it. They were so busted, guys. I remember the day when I finally became brave enough to wear them outside for the first time. I went to the mall with my stepmom and the tape started peeling off. It started falling apart when I was out and about.... Carmelina:.. As soon as you moved. LOL... Lori:.. Thank God for sports. Seriously, that was my saving grace. It was forgiven to be kinda weird because I was a good athlete... Megan:.. Thatâs the common denominator for everybody, I think. âWell, sheâs a little weird, but sheâs good at sports, so I mean â¦â.. Carmelina:.. Totally... Lori:.. Without sports, I wouldâve been the weird brother from Wedding Crashers. Todd... Megan:.. âLetâs play tummy sticks!â LOL... Lori:.. No oneâs gonna know what weâre talking about. Playersâ Tribune, can you please post a picture of Todd from Wedding Crashers? Rachael:.. Everyone is Todd in sixth grade though, right? Sixth grade is literally the worst. Megan, you hit the wall in sixth grade... Megan:.. I donât know what happened. I was so cool at first. And then we flipped. I had to speak for you in kindergarten... Rachael:.. I was mute... Megan:.. I think I peaked in kindergarten. Double Dutch, nap time, crushed it... Rachael:.. That was the first sign of our athleticism. We ruled the playground... Megan:.. Where did it all go wrong? LOL... Rachael:.. Fifth grade was kinda the last of that innocence. Before things start genderfying. Then in sixth grade it all started to happen. Thatâs when people started having boyfriends and girlfriends and soâ.. Megan:.. I wish I was having girlfriends at that age. I was trying to have boyfriends and it was weird. You had a lot of boyfriends... Rachael:.. Every month and a half. New boyfriend... Lori:.. Oh, you were making the rounds... Megan:.. Thatâs when I started following Rachael, literally. Like there were actually times when she would turn around and just run into me because I would follow her so closely... Rachael:.. Junior high was tough for you... Megan:.. I was just lost. Sports were my whole identity. I had no idea who I was or what was happening. Lori:.. Were boys in the picture?.. Megan:.. I remember being like, âI donât know if that boyâs attractive or not? I literally donât know.â.. Rachael:.. All the girls would do at lunch was talk about boys. Oh, God. Megan would be like, âYeah â¦ uh â¦ Craig! Heâs dreamy!â Like from a â50s movie... Megan:.. I only had two things. I had sports, and I had my sister. Rach was such a social butterfly and totally comfortable in that atmosphere, and I wasnât. Thank God I could follow you around. I wouldnât have survived without you. I could just be... Carmelina:.. Youâre already making me freaking cry? Already!.. Megan:.. No crying allowed... Rachael:.. Quick, someone tell a funny story before we all cry... Carmelina:.. TALK ABOUT YOUR MOM... Lori:.. Mammer Jammers!.. Megan:.. Please, someone explain Mammer Jammers to the people at home... Rachael:.. Sheâs going to kill us for this. O.K. We call her Mammer Jammers because, well, when she went through menopauseâ.. Megan:.. Which was when we were in like high school and college... Rachael:.. âher pajama game somehow became a huge topic of conversation. She was so particular about them, down to every detail... Megan:.. Has to be cotton pajamas. And she has such a sensitive sense of smell that, in her words, she has to wear a different pair of pajamas every day because she doesnât want to sleep in âalready-wornâ pajamas.  A new pair everyday was a non-negotiable... Rachael:.. So weâd go on vacation. Four days, four pairs of pajamas... Megan:.. She came to the 2011 World Cup in Germany, eight pairs of pajamas. We ended up extending her stay because we made the final, and she had to go to H&M and buy new âjamas. They werenât exactly what she wanted, but she had to make do. Carmelina:.. You guys are dead for this. Sheâs already googled this article... Megan:.. You really donât want to get on her bad side. I think the last time we made her mad was 10th grade... Rachael:.. The house party. We tried to pull the wool over Jammerâs eyes. We picked up all our friends in our baller 1988 white Dodge Caravan. What was the party? I remember someoneâs parents were out of town... Megan:.. Greg Bambino... Rachael:.. Greg Bambino... Lori:.. Greg Bambino?.. Megan:.. His name was really Greg Bambino. Great name!.. Rachael:.. Great party. Early 2000s. A little Sisqo coming from the computer speakers. I think we probably had like one six-pack for 14 people... Megan:.. At about 11:30, the flip phones start blowing up. All the girlsâ phones at once... Rachael:.. Panic. Mass panic. Jammers had foiled our scheme. Now all the moms were alerted... Megan:.. Poor Bambino was freaking out. He knew Jammersâ reputation. When we got home, nothing even had to be said. We just went to our room. Iâm pretty sure that was the last time we had a beer until college... Rachael:.. We were so cool. We literally partied once and failed. Lori:.. What did she make of you two at that point?.. Megan:.. The thing was, as crazy protective as she was, she never pushed us in sports. Her and my dad, Jim, knew we were good, but I donât know if they knew we were as good as we were.  I donât know if w

Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe has her Day, in  Absentia, as the Redding Council Discusses  Drones, Power Plants and Salaries – anewscafe.com Menu Close Home News Opinion Recipes Advertise Contact Us Subscribe 2 Soccer Star Megan Rapinoe has her Day, in  Absentia, as the Redding Council Discusses  Drones, Power Plants and Salaries Posted on July 22, 2015 by Jon Lewis Mayor Francie Sullivan congratulates Megan Rapinoe’s parents Jim and Denise Rapinoe as Mike Woodrum, co-owner of Jack’s Grill, looks on. Even though she was 420 miles to the north, in Portland, Ore., Women’s World Cup soccer standout andPalo Cedro native Megan Rapinoe starred at Tuesday’s Redding City Council meeting as the mayorproclaimed July 21 Megan Rapinoe Day. Accepting the proclamation on behalf of their daughter were proud parents Jim and Denise Rapinoe ofRedding and Mike Woodrum, the co-owner of Jack’s Grill, where Denise Rapinoe has worked as awaitress for the past 27 years. “We are very honored to be here accepting this on Megan’s behalf,” Denise Rapinoe said, noting that herdaughter was in Portland with her club team, the Seattle Reign, preparing for Wednesday’s match againstthe Portland Thorns. Mayor Francie Sullivan said she was sorry Rapinoe couldn’t be present but appreciated the fact she hadcommitments preventing her from attending. Shortly after Rapinoe, 30, and her U.S. Women’s national soccer teammates put the finishing touches ona sound thumping of Japan to win the 2015 FIFA World Cup, Sullivan said she considered organizing aticker-tape parade in Rapinoe’s honor. “And then I thought, oh no, New York would just be jealous ofus,” Sullivan said with a laugh. On a more serious note, Sullivan added, “We are just proud beyond our ability to say that this youngwoman is out there making the north state to look like the best place in America to raise kids.” Councilwoman Missy McArthur also addressed Rapinoe’s parents, telling them “thanks for being part ofthis community and raising such a great young woman.” Rapinoe, a Foothill High School graduate, also starred on the U.S. Women’s national soccer team thatwon Olympic gold in 2012. In other action Tuesday, the council: — Discussed the relatively new phenomenon of privately owned drones being operated in the vicinity ofwildland fires. Both the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) and the ForestService have had to ground air attack aircraft after the planes recently encountered drones in the air atfour different fires, City Manager Kurt Starman said. “When I heard that, I thought we can’t be having that at all,” said Councilman Gary Cadd, who requestedthe matter be placed on the agenda for Tuesday night’s discussion. Drones are small, unmanned aircraftthat can be remotely operated to hover and photograph buildings, events, crowds, landscapes and prettymuch anything else. “There’s a distinct threat of a midair collision between a drone and (fire attack) aircraft,” said ReddingFire Chief Gerry Gray. He added that there have been several instances of drones spotted over fires inRedding, but in each case firefighting aircraft were not in use. A drone was observed while Redding firefighters were tackling a small grass fire near Tarmac Road andHighway 44. The drone’s operator could not be located, Gray said. In another instance, a drone wasobserved at the June 18 blaze that burned three acres near the Sacramento River across from CaldwellPark. In that case, the operator was identified and cooperated with officials. Rod Dinger, Redding’s airport director, said recreational or non-commercial drone operators are requiredto alert the city when flying drones within a five-mile radius of either Redding Municipal Airport orBenton Airpark. Those two zones cover almost all of the city of Redding as well as parts of Anderson. Commercial drone operators need to obtain a certificate of exemption in order to operate within thoseairport zones, Dinger said. To date, only one commercial operator (contracted by Verizon Wireless toinspect cell phone towers) has applied for a certificate.At present, the Federal Aviation Administration is focusing on educating drone operators rather thanprosecuting them, Dinger said. “This is not a game,” Cadd said. “We need a whole bunch of education inthe field.” — Voted 5-0 to divest from the San Juan Generating Station, a coal-fired electrical generation plant inNew Mexico that the city invested in along with Modesto and Santa Rosa. According to Barry Tippin, theassistant city manager and Redding Electric Utility director, the city has benefitted from its participationin the project for the past 32 years. Times change, though, and now a host of plant improvements mandated by the Environmental ProtectionAgency (with an estimated cost of $800 million) threaten to turn the power plant into a liability, Tippinsaid. “It is not a benefit to Redding ratepayers,” he said, noting that if Redding remained involved itwould be paying more for San Juan power than it would for power generated by the city’s own gas-firedturbines. Redding will remain responsible for $26.6 million in bond debt through the year 2037. Pulling out of thepower plant is not a cost benefit to the city, Tippin said, but it is the cheapest way to get out of anincreasingly expensive proposition. As an aside, Tippin noted that Redding decided to invest in the coal-fired plant in 1982 after voters passeda referendum banning the city from investing in nuclear power. “If we had invested in nuclear, we’d stillbe going strong.” — Voted 5-0 to give a 5 percent raise to whoever is hired to replace outgoing Director of DevelopmentServices Bill Nagel. A recruitment for his replacement attracted 18 applicants and both of the top twofinalists, citing the city’s pay range, withdrew their applications. Based on that experience, Personnel Director Sheri DeMaagd recommended increasing the position’smonthly salary from $11,074 to $11,628. She also recommended the council approve a $16,500 contractwith CPS HR Consulting, a headhunting firm, to conduct a comprehensive executive recruitment forNagel’s replacement.
